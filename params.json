  "body": "Some say big data is the answer. Although the health care industry has been notoriously slow to harness its power.\r\n\r\nAccelerating costs are forcing payors and health-care providers to shift from a fee-for-service approach (the more treatments, the better) to one that favors patient outcomes (rewarding providers for targeted treatments that actually work).\r\n\r\nPhysicians are continuing to move towards evidence-based medicine, reviewing data from a huge range of sources before making treatment decisions.\r\n\r\nPersonalized Medicine\r\n\r\nImagine you’re a doctor treating a patient with cancer. In the past, you might have based your treatment plan on the results of double-blind studies. These studies may have been rigorous, but they may have failed to take patient differences into account.\r\n\r\nBig data changes the game. Now you can merge and analyze data sets from:\r\n\r\n* Clinical trials\r\n* Direct observations of other physicians\r\n* Electronic medical records\r\n* Online patient networks\r\n* Genomics research (see below) and more…\r\n\r\nOne of the top goals is to create a personalized treatment plan based on individual biology. Instead of treating your patient with a drug that works 80% of the time (e.g., the breast cancer drug, Tamoxifen), you can employ data science to custom-tailor a regimen just for her.\r\n\r\nGenomics\r\n\r\nInexpensive DNA sequencing and next-generation genomic technologies are changing the way health care providers do business. \r\n\r\nPredictive Analytics and Preventive Measures\r\n\r\nPrevention is always better than cure. For the health-care industry, it also happens to save a lot of money. (The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, for instance, can penalize hospitals that exceed average rates of readmission – indicating that they could be doing more to prevent medical problems.)\r\n\r\nSelf-Motivated Care\r\n\r\nIt’s a “patient heal thyself” world, now. Developments like personal genetic testing (e.g., 23andMe.com), online patient networks and behavioral apps like Be Well are allowing individuals to take control of their own health.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.7thsymbol.co\r\nA Digital Health transformation agile collaboration between, medics and their finger on the pulse, web developers, graphic designers, for a saving of lives.\r\n\r\nThere’s no shame in starting small when you’re laying the foundation for something great. That’s precisely what we’re doing. We’ll share more when we’re ready, so check back with us soon.\r\n\r\n",
